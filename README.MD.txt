# **Negrito** First I would like to say, this don't have commercial intention, and don't have permission to this to.
## So know this, than the interface  is created using React Native whith Expo. Yarn to be the Packege Manager and
## FontAwesome to be the Icons.
### To recreate the interface, you'll need install a little things:

With you don't want to use Yarn you can also use NPM. It's simple just convert where have yarn add to npm i or npm install.
Exemple: yarn add @react-navigation/native/npm i @react-navigation/native or npm install @react-navigation/native

First of all you'll need install NodeJs: 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Yarn to Packege Manager: 
npm install -g yarn

React-Native: 
yarn add global react-native
yarn add global react-native-cli

Navigation: 
yarn add @react-navigation/native
yarn add react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
(To more details -> https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/)

yarn add @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core

I recommend to use the comand: npx react-native run-android to create your app in PhoneDevice.
